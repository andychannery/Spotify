# Spotify

## Goal
This repo serves to house all projects I'll be working on relating to the Spotify API.

#### Project #1
To build my own classifier to predict which songs I'll like from 'Discover Weekly'. Predicted liked songs will be added to a 'vetting' playlist for me to manually review. Whole process will be scheduled to occur on a weekly cadence aligning with 'Discover Weekly' updating every Monday.

## Milestones
As of: 11/11/2023
1. Fetch song data
2. EDA
3. Building classification model
4. Update personal playlist
5. Deploying
